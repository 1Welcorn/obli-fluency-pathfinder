## üîß Production Configuration Check

### Environment Variables for Production

Since your app is deployed on GitHub Pages, you'll need to configure environment variables through GitHub Secrets:

1. **Go to your GitHub repository**
2. **Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions**
3. **Add the following secrets:**

```bash
# Required for Gemini AI
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here

# Optional for enhanced features
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
VITE_SSH_GEMINI_HOST=your-server.com
VITE_SSH_GEMINI_API_ENDPOINT=https://your-server.com/api
```

### Firebase Configuration for Production

Your Firebase configuration should work in production since it's hardcoded in `services/firebaseConfig.ts`:

```typescript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyDjIoXRZtbkAMOpCgt-XchEs5I2X0k-oEo",
  authDomain: "obli-fluency-pathfinder.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "obli-fluency-pathfinder",
  storageBucket: "obli-fluency-pathfinder.firebasestorage.app",
  messagingSenderId: "361914234340",
  appId: "1:361914234340:web:12a2f9d022d5bf0e4103f1",
  measurementId: "G-NTJ1CXRKKH"
};
```

**Verify in Firebase Console:**
- [ ] Project is active
- [ ] API key has correct permissions
- [ ] Firestore rules allow public access
- [ ] Authentication providers are enabled

---

## üöÄ Deployment Process

### Current Deployment Method: GitHub Pages

Your application is deployed using GitHub Pages, which means:

1. **Source:** Main branch of your repository
2. **Build Process:** Automatic via GitHub Actions (if configured)
3. **Domain:** `https://1welcorn.github.io/obli-fluency-pathfinder/`

### To Update the Live Application:

1. **Make changes** to your local code
2. **Commit and push** to the main branch:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update application"
   git push origin main
   ```
3. **Wait for deployment** (usually 1-2 minutes)
4. **Test the changes** on the live site

## üîç Troubleshooting Production Issues

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. **Firebase Connection Errors**
**Symptoms:** Authentication fails, data doesn't save
**Solutions:**
- Check Firebase Console for project status
- Verify API key permissions
- Check browser console for CORS errors
- Ensure Firestore rules allow your operations

#### 2. **Gemini API Not Working**
**Symptoms:** AI features don't respond, learning plans not generated
**Solutions:**
- Set up `GEMINI_API_KEY` in GitHub Secrets
- Verify API key is valid and has quota
- Check browser console for API errors

#### 3. **Static Assets Not Loading**
**Symptoms:** Images, CSS, or JS files return 404
**Solutions:**
- Check if build process completed successfully
- Verify file paths in the built application
- Clear browser cache

#### 4. **CORS Issues**
**Symptoms:** API calls fail with CORS errors
**Solutions:**
- Check if your proxy server is running
- Verify CORS configuration in `proxy-server.js`
- Consider using a different proxy service

    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
