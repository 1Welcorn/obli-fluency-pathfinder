# Welcome Page Fix Guide

## Issue Identified
The welcome page is not working properly because the **GEMINI_API_KEY** is set to a placeholder value (`PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY`) in the `.env.local` file.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Improved Error Handling
- Enhanced error messages in `WelcomeScreen.tsx` to provide specific feedback when AI services are not configured
- Improved error handling in `App.tsx` for learning plan generation
- Updated `geminiService.ts` to detect placeholder API keys and provide clear error messages

### 2. Better User Experience
- Users now get helpful error messages instead of generic failures
- The app gracefully handles missing API configuration
- Users can still use the app even without AI features (they just need to write their own learning goals)

## How to Fix the API Key Issue

### Step 1: Get a Gemini API Key
1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "Create API Key"
4. Copy the generated API key

### Step 2: Update Your Environment File
Open the `.env.local` file in your project root and replace the placeholder:

```bash
# Change this line:
GEMINI_API_KEY=PLACEHOLDER_API_KEY

# To this (with your actual API key):
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

### Step 3: Restart the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## What Works Now

### ✅ Fixed Issues:
- **Better Error Messages**: Users get clear feedback when AI features aren't available
- **Graceful Degradation**: The app works even without AI configuration
- **Improved User Experience**: Specific error messages help users understand what's wrong

### ✅ Features That Work:
- **Welcome Page**: Displays correctly with proper form validation
- **Manual Goal Entry**: Users can write their own learning goals
- **Grade Level Selection**: Works properly
- **Form Submission**: Processes correctly (though AI features need API key)
- **Error Handling**: Shows helpful messages instead of crashes

### ⚠️ Features That Need API Key:
- **"Suggest a focus for me" button**: Requires valid Gemini API key
- **Learning plan generation**: Requires valid Gemini API key

## Testing the Fix

1. **Without API Key**: The welcome page should load and show helpful error messages when trying to use AI features
2. **With API Key**: All features should work including AI suggestions and plan generation

## Next Steps

1. Get your Gemini API key from Google AI Studio
2. Update the `.env.local` file with your real API key
3. Restart the development server
4. Test all features to ensure everything works properly

The welcome page should now work correctly with much better error handling and user experience!
